# Book Search Engine

## Description

A platform for searching for and saving your favorite books built using the MERN stack, a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. I learned a lot about the tiny things that can cause you to waste hours, such as using the wrong version of node.js. But ultimately, I got this refactoring project to work with some help from my tutor. It also helped to solifiy the deployement process with Heroku and Github.
